    3.1.1 Water Level
    CO-OPS generates CREX water level bulletins containing the most recent six samples of sixminute observed water level data and associated tidal residuals, which are calculated by
    subtracting astronomical tides from the observed water levels. Great Lakes stations are not
    tidal, therefore, residual values are not calculated. Bulletins containing the six-minute data are
    issued every thirty minutes. An example follows, and more detail on the CREX structure is
    provided in Appendix 2.

    In the message header:
    • KSAA30 KWBC is the WMO header for the North Atlantic CREX message, per
    Appendix 4.
    • 311844: The bulletin was created on day 31 at 18:44 GMT.
    In the Data Description section:
    • D01021: The message contains latitude and longitude.
    • D06025: The message contains a station ID, date/time, sea surface temperature,
    quality control checks, and time increments, and a repeat of six water level values
    (referenced to chart datum) and associated residuals [REF 3]. Chart datum is Mean
    Lower Low Water (MLLW) for coastal areas, and Low Water Datum (LWD) for the
    Great Lakes.

    In the Data section:
    • 3237339 and -06470331 are the latitude and longitude respectively, and are provided to
    5 decimal places, as described in CREX/BUFR Table D [REF 3]. In this case, the
    coordinates are 32.37339 N and 64.70331 W. Note that positive latitude/longitude
    values correspond to North and East, respectively and negative values correspond to
    South and West, respectively.
    • BEPB6 is the National Weather Service Location Identifier (NWSLI) for Bermuda.
    Appendix 1 provides a list of the stations and associated NWSLI and NOS station
    identifiers.
    • 2013 07 31 17 54 is the base time (7/31/2013 17:54 GMT) used to calculate the
    measurement times for the water level values contained in the bulletin for the given
    station.
    • 3038 is the sea surface temperature in Kelvin to the tenths (303.8 K).
    • 00 07 are two checks that indicate the overall quality of the data. The first set of digits is
    the automated water level check and indicates the quality of the data (see Appendix 5 for
    a list of all automated checks). 00, per Appendix 5, indicates the data quality is good.
    The second set of digits is the manual water level check that is presently not used,
    therefore will always be set to 07, as defined in WMO Manual on Codes [REF 2].
    • 00 06 are time increments applied to the base time to calculate the measurement
    timestamp of the first and oldest water level value for the given station. 00 indicates the
    number of minutes that must be added to the first measurement, which is 0. The
    following 06 indicates the time increment between observations, and is also added to
    the base time to determine the timestamp of the first observation123.
    In a six-minute water level bulletin, a data record contains six water level values and six
    associated residuals (except at Great Lakes stations). All data are reported in GMT, and are in
    millimeters. To determine the time of each 6-minute observation123 start with the base time
    provided in the station header record, which in this case is 7/31/2013 17:54 GMT. The station
    header record indicates 00 minutes need to be added to 17:54 to calculate the observation123
    time for the first and oldest water level value. Then 06 minutes are added to the first value and
    then each succeeding observation123 time. This means for BEPB6 the data listing is:
